Once upon a time, There were two scientists who lived in China and wanted to destroy 
the world through a bio war by developing a virus which can turn people to zombies 
who will be killing other people for their meat and blood . They were working together
on the virus for a long time but one day they had a big Quarrel between them .
The quarrel lead to the spread of the virus in air and they were infected . 
Soon, they turned into zombies. Later , the virus was spread in other parts of the
world too and came to be known as Z-18 virus.  Now, the world came to an end but 
there  were some people who were left uninfected , they went to a castle for their 
protection who was guarded by a brave soldier who killed these zombies by his tank
and protected the people.

The few people left were rescued by the brave soldier. Then they all setted up their own
happy town in which they lived peacefully without any war. After a few decades later things 
became back to normal and now there were no diseases.
